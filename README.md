# Vexio AI interface

## Overview

This project is a chat interface built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It includes animated components to enhance user experience, utilizing Framer Motion for smooth transitions.

## Features

- **Chat Input**: A text area with dynamic resizing and a submit button.
- **Animations**:
  - Fade-in effect for the chat input form.
  - Smooth button transitions and visual feedback during submission.
- **Responsiveness**: Fully responsive design using Tailwind CSS

## Development

### Setup

1. Clone `git@github.com:VipinDevelops/vexio-ai-interface.git`
2. Run `npm install` to install all of the project's dependencies
3. Build the project for production: `npm run build`
4. Run the local development server: `npm run dev`

## Challenges Faced

Animation Timing: Syncing animations with form submission events required careful tweaking of Framer Motionâ€™s transition durations.

### Future Improvements

Custom Themes: Allow users to switch between different themes for the chat interface.
